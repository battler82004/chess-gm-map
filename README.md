# chess-gm-map
Python program to save a series of maps of the number of chess GMs by country for my GEOG 6N term project. 
To run:
* Use anaconda and a geopandas environment.
* Unzip countryReferenceMap.zip
* Create 3 folders: generatedMaps, mappingData, and thematicData
* Run thematicDataGenerator.py
* Run mapFilesGenerator.py
* Run main.py
* At this point, all of the data has been generated by each program with the final maps in the generatedMaps folder
